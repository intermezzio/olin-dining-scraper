# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to this dining hall scraper!

Features, comment ideas, and all possible improvements are encouraged. The comments this script generates about menu items are randomly chosen from the `assets/*.txt` files, where random comment templates, adjectives, ways to describe eating, and more are auto-generated. Each line in these text files is a possible output. Add any new content to the bottom of these files and make a pull request to have your comments possibly featured in a future email!

All other changes can be requested with an issue or a pull request. If the change is a quick fix (e.g. reformatting part of the email message), a pull request will suffice. If it's a larger change, like creating a new algorithm to generate comments, an issue (and potentially a pull request) would be ideal.
